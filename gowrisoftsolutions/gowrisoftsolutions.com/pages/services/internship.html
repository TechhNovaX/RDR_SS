                              A recent study in The Times newspaper showed that graduates who undertake internships increase their chances of being noticed by an employer.
 An internship is a temporary work placement – sometimes a few months over a summer break, sometimes part-time work throughout your degree. It might be paid, usually at an hourly rate, or unpaid, in which case you should at least expect some expenses (such as food and travel to work) to be covered. Many employers recruit their new graduates directly from their internship program, so it’s the best way to get your foot in the door.
